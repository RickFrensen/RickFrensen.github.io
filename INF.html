<h2 align="center" id="I">Ranks</h2>
<p>We have a lot of other ranks for the server. The rank you all got is Citizen but here is also a rank for people who did special things for the server for example: Discover 3 hackers. For that you get the rank Pumpkin, if you do more you will get Pumpkin General. they both have fly an pumpkin general will get more command later. We have this rank because we want to do something extra for the people who help us.</p>
<p>We alse have a Youtuber rank. This rank is available when you hit the 100 subscribers. The extra things you get with this rank is that you get fly. We give fly because it is very ahndly with building stuff and for making a video. Also you are permitted to advertise for your channel.</p>
<p>Ofcourse we also have donator ranks. This are the ranks you can buy the help the server out. The ranks there are available are: Knight, Wizard, Queen and King. The King and Queen rank are the same but we made 2. One for the boys and one for the girls. For futher information go to Ranks.</p>
<p> Fun fact: did you knew the pumpkin pumpkin amry was created on an other server by Rick when he was bored.</p>
