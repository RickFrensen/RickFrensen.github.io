<h2 align="center" id="I">Zomie-Attack</h2>
<p> Zombie-Attack is a game based on zombies from BO II. The goal is to survive as many waves as possible and kill all the zombies. There are five different ranks; Juggernaut, Sniper, Medic, Soldier and Citizen. For now we have only one map but we will make some more soon.

<h2 align="center" id="I">Skywars</h2>
<p> We have skywars at the moment but this game is a little bit bugged. It is playable but the map you play in then isn't the map we wanted. The map where you play in is from the plugin itself because the plugin didn't accept our map.
<h2 align="center" id="I">Skyblock</h2>
<p> Skyblock, the game on the island. It is a game many players like so we've put it in Ellenor too. The game is simple, you spawn on a island with a tree and a chest with some stuff. With these items en the tree you can make amlost everything there is in the game itself and create a large island. You need to make the right decisions or you will fail. So can you make a new world?</p>
<h2 align="center" id="I">Paintball</h2>
<p>Paintball is a game where you shoot snowballs at each other to get points and money. With the money you earn you can buy special equipment to defeat your opponents. With the points you earn, can can rank up. Everytime you rank up, you get more stuff you can buy in the shop. At the Moment we have only one map. But we will make some more shortly.
