<p align="left">The World is a roleplay world with different races and kingdoms. The world is huge and all made in World Painter by Jeroen, our admin. Because we have spend a lot of time in this map and to make the roleplay fun we don't let anyone build. If you want to build in The World you need to show how good you are in the Creative world. Futher we are going to do Friendly Wars. With this we mean wars</p>

<h2 align="center" id="I">The story (season 1, A new begin)</h2>

<p align="left">There where 3 kingdoms to start with: the Dwarves (Obelion), the Humans (Escavilia) and the Elves (Ilithia). They came after some hunders maybe a few thousand years back to there homeland. After the first war there lands were on fire and they had to go elsewere. now they have returned en are rebuilding the great kingdom they ones had. After there return many things happen. They see mobs walking back on the lands again and there nurbers are growing. When they searched for the problem they find a portal. A portal of the dark wizard. But that is not all what happend. They also meet a wizard who goes with the name OldWiseMan. he is very wise and will help everyone with everything and his only enemy is the dark wizard. Then there are the gods; Falron from Obelion, Lithrin from Ilithia and Idysius from Escavilia. each of these have different areas where they are specialiced in. Falron is the god of stone and war, Lithrin is the god of nature and life and Idysius is the god of trading and harvest. so what ever you do there is a god. In season 1 they met a new kingdom: the Dragonians (Zéregräs), a kingdom witch has survived the war and has lived there all the time the others were gone. This kingdom had grown in power and overrun the others in power. When they go and talk to the king he attacked the others immediately. from what they heard him yelling he has been given wwrong information about them. From the dark wizard! This isn't a wonder because in hunderds of years a lot of information get lost and told wrong. Even the others have forgotten there past. For example they had forgotten there gods. But let us go futher on the story. After finding out the Dragonians are getting manipulate they want back to there kingdoms to prepare for war because if the dragonians really are getting manipulated they are in danger.</p>
<p> Fun fact: did you knew that TW was set up in only 3 days.

<h2 align="center" id="I">The story (season 2, The time of war.)</h2>

<p align="left">Season 2 starter with that OldWiseMan called every kingdom to his house. after gathering there the wnt with boats to a island. A island that has been hidden by magic. On that island was a huge castle and after climbing the largest tower the OldWiseMan told them:"I am not alone, there are four other wizards, each specialiced in a different area". After telling this he took each of the king alone and told them there were others of there kind. Now some of the kings have found the others, some haven't and some already knew. One of the new kigndoms is called Dol Gort. This is another dwarven kingdom full of snow. The dwarves of Obelion found them and told them everything they had to know. How the Dragonians declared war to everyone and that they live next to them but that knowbody knew that and also that they need to make some defends because if the Dragonians find them they will certainly attack them because of there strategic position. Also the Elves have found the other race of Elves but this was a long time ago. These other Elves are from Entium, a small island next to Ilithia. The king of Ilitihia has claimed the island and let the people pay taxes. But how long will they take this? How long will it take them to stand up to there 'king'. And what will the duke of Entium do? Will he watch his people getting exploited or will he start a rebellion? At last we come with the Humans. While I don't know if they have find the other Human race I do know that the other kingdom is called Zevyrion and the people there live in a huge desert. The Zevyrians are fighters and everybody who knows them will think twice when they want to say something to them. This story is almost to its end know but I need to tell you one more thing. The kingdoms are preparing for war. Will you help them? Will you bring them to victory and save the world? I'll see you there.<img src="http://www.cinemablend.com/images/sections/54678/The_Hobbit__Armies_of_the_Third_Age_54678.jpg" alt="Dwarf" width="550" height="450"/></p>
<p>Fun fact: however the dwarves have a huge army and the most people online everytime they are probably weaker then the Dragonians who are with only 2.</p>
